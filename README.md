# Chess

Description: The following program is an implementation of the classic chess game. 
Will have the ability to play in two different modes (PvP & PvCPU).
The program currently displays the planned GUI that we intend to use and some functionality of the game.
There will be a couple options in the system menu tab (not currently functional).
The general layout and design is there but we have more work to do.

Description: The following program is an implementation of the classic chess game. Will have the ability to play in two different modes (PvP & PvCPU).
The program currently displays the planned GUI that we intend to use and some functionality of the game.
There will be a couple options in the system menu tab (not currently functional).
The general layout and design is there but we have more work to do.

Final Submission Report: There was no changes made to the SRS. The final report is consistant with the SRS. 

Compile/Run: To run the program, you should simply be able to cd into the src repository and run the make file.
This program has been tested to compile and run on the ENCS lab computers. Command â€”> $make && make run
